# TitanicMLProject

This project explores the Titanic dataset using machine learning to **predict survival outcomes** and **discover hidden data patterns**. It combines both **supervised** (classification) and **unsupervised** (clustering) techniques to demonstrate real-world data science workflows, including data cleaning, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

- **Supervised Learning**: Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to predict whether a passenger survived based on features like age, class, and fare.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Used clustering (K-Means) to find natural groupings of passengers and interpret insights without labeled outcomes.
- **Goal**: Practice end-to-end ML using a real dataset, understand how different algorithms behave, and generate insights from structured data.

## ðŸ§  Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.12  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- **IDE Used**: PyCharm  
- **Dataset**: `titanicdata.csv`
